-- For this project, I used Spotify data downloaded from Kraggle to create a table to perform data analytics on.

-- The following code was used to create the table:
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
song_key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
song_mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness decimal(8,7) NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL )

--Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table. Next, I explored the data using the following SQL. 
-- 1. Which artist has the highest average danceability?
SELECT artist_name, AVG(danceability)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY danceability desc
;

-- 2. What is the most popular track?
SELECT track_name
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity desc
LIMIT 1
;

-- 3. Which artist has released the most tracks and how many have they released?
SELECT artist_name, COUNT(track_id) as amount
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY amount desc
LIMIT 1
;
